  ## Description

  This is an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This application will use an express backend and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

  ## Installation

  Install Node.js by following this link (Mac) “https://www.webucator.com/how-to/how-install-nodejs-on-mac.cfm” Then run “npm install” in your terminal 

  ## Usage

  Simply click on the link below and then click "Get Started". Then fill out the "Title" and "Text" areas and hit the save icon. This will save those inputs in the side bar where you can view them later. These notes will also have a delete icon which will remove them from the list.
